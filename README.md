# Vendure Angular Storefront

This is an e-commerce storefront application which is designed to be used with the [Vendure ecommerce framework](https://github.com/vendure-ecommerce/vendure) as a back end.

It is a progressive web application (PWA) which also uses Angular Universal for server-side rendering.

The app is built with the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), with the data layer being handled by [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client).

## Development

0. Clone this repo
1. Run `npm install` or `yarn` in the root dir
2. Run `npm start` or `yarn start` to build in development mode.
3. Make sure you have a local Vendure instance running a `http://localhost:3000`.
4. Open `http://localhost:4201` to see the storefront app running.

## Code generation

This project uses [graphql-code-generator](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/) to generate TypeScript types based on the Vendure GraphQL API. To update the types, first change the `schema` property of [codegen.yml](./codegen.yml) to point to your local Vendure server, and then run the `generate-types` npm script.

## Deployment

To deploy this storefront in a production environment, take the following steps:

1. Open the [environment.prod.ts file](./src/environments/environment.prod.ts) and change the values to match your deployed Vendure server. You also probably want to set the `baseHref` value to `'/'` rather than `'/storefront/'`.
2. Open the [angular.json file](./angular.json) and set the baseHref values to point to root:
    ```diff
      "production": {
    -    "baseHref": "/storefront/",
    -    "deployUrl": "/storefront/", 
    +    "baseHref": "/",
    +    "deployUrl": "/", 
    ```
3. You then need to build for production using the `build:ssr` npm script. This can be done either locally or on your production server, depending on your preferred workflow.
4. The built artifacts will be found in the `dist/` directory. The command to run the storefront as a server-rendered app is `node dist/server/main.js`. This will start a node server running on port 4000. You should configure your webserver to pass requests arriving on port 80 to `localhost:4000`.
5. In the Vender server config, configure the `EmailPlugin` to point to the correct routes used by this storefront:
   ```ts
   EmailPlugin.init({
     // ...
     globalTemplateVars: {
       fromAddress: '"Example_Server" <noreply@example.com>',
       verifyEmailAddressUrl: 'https://your-domain.com/account/verify',
       passwordResetUrl: 'https://your-domain.com/account/reset-password',
       changeEmailAddressUrl: 'https://your-domain.com/account/change-email-address',
     }
   })
   ```

### Deploying the demo

This project is used in the [angular-storefront.vendure.io](https://angular-storefront.vendure.io) demo. There is a [GitHub Actions workflow](./.github/workflows/build.yml) which is triggered whenever a new tag is added. The tag should be of the format `"vX.Y.Z"`. The workflow will run the `build:ssr` script and upload the compiled output to an Amazon S3 bucket, from which the vendure-demo project will pull the artifacts.

Once the GitHub action workflow has completed and the built artifacts have been successfully uploaded to the S3 bucket, the app can be deployed with `git push dokku master`.
